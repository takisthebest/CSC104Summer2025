            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML provudes the structure of the webpage by marking up the text. 
               You can (and should) use variety of HTML tags to build the webpage content. 
               HTML does not have many rules (other than if you opn a tag, you sould usually close it).
            One and only one h1 tag is a best practice.</p>

               CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a language that exists to make HTML look better. CSS can control
               layout, colors, fonts - basically any visual element on the page can be changed from the default browser style 
               using CSS.
