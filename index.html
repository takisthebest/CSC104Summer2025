                     I'm based in Arizona with my 12 year old son and two cats, studying at UAT, 
                     finishing my Bachelor's in Game Design on my way to a Master's in Game Production. <br>
                     As someone whose favorite hobbies are drawing, programming, rolling dice and flipping cards with friends,
                     this is exactly what I would be doing whether or not it was my career.<br>
                     I recently started Pumpkn Games LLC and have had my first project published on Steam. <br>
                     Please enjoy some of my favorite projects, and let me help you make something fun.<br>
                    </p>
